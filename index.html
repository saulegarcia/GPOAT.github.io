           Art is a collection of human activities in the development of visual, auditory or performing objects (artworks), 
		   reflecting the artistic, creative or technological abilities of the artist intended to be admired for their beauty or emotional energy.
		   Many practices related to the creation of art works include art criticism, the study of art history and aesthetic dissemination
		   [clarification needed] of art. Painting, sculpture, and architecture are the three classical branches of Art.
		   A wider concept of the arts encompasses music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, and other platforms such as digital media.
		   Art referred to any skill or expertise until the 17th century, and was not distinguished from the crafts or sciences. In post-17th century modern usage, 
		   where esthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are isolated and differentiated from commonly learned skills, such as decorative or applied arts.
           Although the concept of what constitutes art is complex and has changed over time, general definitions refer to an idea of creative,
		   or technological capacity derived from human agency[8] and development. In a branch of philosophy known as esthetics,
		   the essence of the art and related concepts such as imagination and perception are discussed

           Music is an art form, and a cultural practice which has a sound medium. General music meanings include specific elements such as pitch (which regulates melody and harmony),
		   rhythm (and its related principles of speed, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and timbre and texture sonic qualities
		   (which are often referred to as the "color" of a musical sound). Some of these elements can be underlined, de-emphasised or omitted by various forms or types of music.
		   Music is performed with a wide variety of instruments and vocal methods ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental parts, solely vocal parts
		   (such as songs without musical accompaniment) and pieces incorporating singing and instruments.

          Movie, also known as movie or motion picture, is a visual art form used to depict experiences that express ideas, stories, thoughts, emotions, beauty or
		  atmosphere through captured or programmed[vague] moving images, along with sound (and more rarely) other sensory stimulus. 
		  The term "cinema," short for cinematography, is also used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and the subsequent art form.
		  A film's moving images are generated by photographing real scenes with a camera, photographing drawings or miniature models using conventional animation techniques,
		  using CGI and computer animation, or incorporating any or both of these techniques with other visual effects.

	   A dining room is a area where food is consumed. In modern times for ease in serving it is usually adjacent to the kitchen,
	   but in medieval times it was always on a completely different level of the house. 
	   Historically the dining room is furnished with a very large dining table and a number of dining chairs;
	   the most typical type is usually rectangular with two protected end chairs and an equal number of unarmed side chairs along the long sides.
